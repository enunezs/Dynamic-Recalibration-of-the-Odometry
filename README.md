# Dynamic-Recalibration-of-the-Odometry
Code for EMATM0054 assignment


Three flavors available:

 1.  DynamicRecalibration: Moves along a track with nodes until finding more than one, and performs recalibration procedure on previous node.
 2.  No_calibration: Mimics movement of option 1 without recalibration
 3.  Ignore_nodes: "Baseline code". Will ignore nodes on track. Works on regular tracks too!
